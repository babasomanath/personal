Background:
Sunita is from an Indian hindu family and has completed her education from Bhubaneswar. I am also from an Indian hindu family and a native from Bhubaneswar. Bhubaneswar, being the home town for both of us, it is quite innate to hang out with the friends in some of the well known places. This was different and i did not meet my friends and met my life partner. I was blown when I saw her for the first time.  I can never go wrong with the dates and it was 13 July 2017.

Jul 2017 : I met her outside a shopping center in Bhubaneswar. I had recently finished my himalaya trip on bike for 8 days and was telling all my adventurous stories. She loved my affinity to yoga and mountaineering. Being a freelancer, her impeccable contribution towards the entertainment industry impressed me. She is adorable all the time, both now and then. We had a fantastic conversation for all-evening.

August 2017 : The physical conversation had switched to the phone conversation as I had to fly for my work. I had decided to go a step further and proposed her to make my life partner.
