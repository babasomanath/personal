Karol Bagh (Name of the Place) -- Close to Connaught Place -- Rank 1 for Bridal Shopping

Ajmal Khan Road (Name of the place in Karol Bagh) has been the mecca for shopping for wedding clothes for years. 

Although once popular for being reasonably priced, today it has shops selling exquisite bridal pieces costing lakhs of rupees. 
“We have good choices of lehengas starting from Rs. 8000 but the work is not that detailed. A good bridal lehenga starts from Rs. 25000 and goes up to Rs. 3.5 lakhs,” says the shopkeeper at New Handloom Emporium (name of the shop).
