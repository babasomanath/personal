Hi Somanath,
 
Thank you for your email.
 
We are working to provide you with detailed guidance for the next steps and will be providing guidance on the visa application in India as well.  However, in the meantime, please could you provide the following documents to me via email:
 
Scans of all pages of your spouse’s current and two previous passports – we understand that this is quite an onerous task but the Irish authorities require the same for the process;
A scanned copy of all pages of your current passport;
Scanned copies of your and your spouse’s birth certificates;
Bank statements – we cannot open the bank statements for your spouse – can you send these as PDFs?;
Your previous 6 months’ worth of bank statements.
