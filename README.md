Lalitha Devi is the Creator. She is known as Devi Adishakti, Bhubaneswari, Tripura Sundari, Parameshwari Maha Sundari
In Srimad Devi Bhagwat Purana's 1st book and 4th chapter. Devi addressed Trimurti as follows:

"I am Adi Parashakti, goddess Bhuvaneshvari. I am the owner of this universe. I am the Absolute Reality. 
I am dynamic in feminine form and static in masculine form. You have appeared to govern the universe through my energy. 
You are the masculine form of Absolute Reality, while I am the feminine form of that Reality. 
I am beyond form, beyond everything, and all the powers of God are contained within me. 
You must know that I am the Eternal limitless energy."

She then said: Brahma! 
You will be generator of the universe; the Goddess Sharada (Saraswati) is your consort, my form by which I will be recognized as the goddess of wisdom and the primeval sound. 
Lord Brahma, this goddess will be with you when you create the universe.

She continued: Lord Narayana! 
You are the Supreme, Immortal Spirit. 
You are formless, yet you take form. 
I assign you to be the preserver of the universe. 
You will take a different incarnations in order to save this universe's inhabitants. 
Oh Narayana! You are the Supreme of all the deities with form. 
You have created Lord Brahma, and Brahma will further create thirty three kind of gods and goddesses. 
My Great Power, goddess Mahakali, has been born from your mystic sleep. You are the Paramatman. 
Your consort will be goddess Shri Maha Lakshmi, my form. Lord Vishnu, this goddess will be with you when you rule/maintain the universe. 
When life evolves, you will take the form of Vishnu, the one who will perform the task of observing and preserving this universe.

At last she instructed: Oh Lord Rudra, the Great Lord, you are the personification of time, which is above all. 
You will perform the task of destroying and regenerating this universe. When you are formless absolute, time stands still. 
It is due to my power that you become dynamic and are capable of bringing about the destruction and regeneration of this universe. 
Our consort is goddess Mahakali, Mahakali is myself, my full form, where Lakshmi and Saraswati just my clone, partial form. 
But due to meditation, you will surpass all my forms. It is then that I will incarnate from your left half in my manifested form. 
This form will be my truest manifested form. Lord Shiva, she will perform the task of destroying evil and will be your consort.

Aum Shakti is used to describe the name of the goddess when she is without attributes. It is hence to consider Adi Shakti as supreme primordial energy. 
If we analyze all the sacred texts of Indian legends then it is legitimate to consider Adi parashakti as supreme being.

--------- I have a fantastic Song for you  --------------
Adi Shakti is regarded as the one who can control all the nine planets. She divides herself to Material Shakti i.e. Durga who splits herself to operate nine planets to maintain cosmic order, Vidya Shakti i.e. Kali as source for 10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu and Maya Shakti, to delude the beings to illusion and also promotes the beings to Ultimate God. As Durga Shakti She is the one who splits herself to NavaDurga provides direction and energy to all planets.

Sun is Governed by Kushmanda Shakti.
Mahagauri operates Rahu.
Kaalratri governs Shani.
Ketu is governed by Goddess Siddhidaatri.

Provider of All Fortunes i.e. Mangal is governed by Goddess Brahmacharini
